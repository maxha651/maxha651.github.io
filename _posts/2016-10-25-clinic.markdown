Me and some friends applied to [LiU Game Conference][liuga] with a prototype for a crazy, cooperative... get-shot-at-er(?) game. So it's kind of based off this [reddit thread][reddit-thread] where there are clinics for near-death experiences allowing people to, well, experience near-death.

One might say that the game doesn't take it as serious as in that thread, but it's a really fun game for being in such an early state. Watch the trailer [here][trailer].

And on another note I was going to fix up this site a bit but it ended in just making this post instead. I guess it doesn't make sense to do anything when there's no content, but honestly I just don't like web stuff so it'll probably stay like this for a while. Hoping to update this a bit more often though. :)
