I've set up this blog thingy to hopefully document some of the more interesting things I do and act as some sort of portfolio. The site uses [Jekyll][jekyll] with [Github pages][github-pages] which should prove easy enough to use.

Right now I'm just trying out this Jekyll stuff. Awesome code snippet:

{% highlight c %}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    printf("Hello world!\n");
}
{% endhighlight %}

[github-pages]:  https://pages.github.com/
